**JamJam**

A little jam session for the Godot XR Game Jam July 2024.

Playing music can be a fun way to pass the time - maybe that's relaxing... or maybe frustrating :P Let's find out!

Play the keyboard, pickup and strum the guitar, or grab the drum sticks and go to town!

Unfortunately, I ran out of time on hand tracking, but it's still fun to try out. Controllers are recommended if you have trouble with hands. With hands, try putting your thumb, index and middle finger together,  pointing up, left hand to move, right to turn.
